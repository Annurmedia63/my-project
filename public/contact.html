           About My Self
        </h1> 
       <p>
       Hello! My name is Abdul Azeez and I am from Nigeria.
       I am living in Nigeria, which is a lovely place to live.
       I have a big family, two young girls and one little boy.
       </p> 
       <p>
       My Wife Baraks is a fashion designer, so she is quite busy all day. 
       She works as housewife and stay at home to take care of the family and I am also very busy. 
       </p>
       <p>
       I study Programming two hours a everyday because
       I want to improve my Programming stuff to help my 
       income and become an active person in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
       In the future, I would like to be a teacher assistant, 
       like my father. 
       </p>
       <p>My best friend is Idris. He studies Programming with me
        and in our free time, we like to go for another thing in
        town or meet up with other friends for work at another area. 
       </p>
       <p>We also like to go to the open Market at weekends and do our
       shopping there. My favourite TV shows are Arabic daytime dramas,
        but I also watch Nigerian Movie with my children. 
       I pick up new words and learn how to pronounce the words correctly.
       I love my new life in the Nigeria, but if I have an opportunity to 
       go to another country iâ€™ll be glad.
       </p>
